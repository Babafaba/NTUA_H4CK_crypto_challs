These are the challenges I authored for NTUA_H4CK CTF, part of the NTUA_H4CK 2.0 3-day event organized by CS NTUA on 15-16-17 of December 2023.\
"Beginner_Crypto" contains the easier crypto challenges that where part of the "Beginner" category while the "Crypto" folder has the rest, that where in the actual Crypto category of the CTF.\
Source, output and writeups are all included.
